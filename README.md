# :wave: Hello! I'm Simone

I am a full stack engineer with a passion for front end development. 

I have always been interested in coding which led me to complete a Full Stack Engineering Bootcamp in early 2024.

I am naturally curious and listen to podcasts and watch youtube videos covering diverse topics such as investing, emerging technology, coding, history and neuroplasticity. I also enjoy diving into courses on Codecademy and Udacity and have recently finished one on AI. 

Learning through these platforms is not just a hobby, it's a passion of mine that keeps me engaged and I am constantly seeking new avenues of knowledge and growth.
